# Release

The release package are upload by Travis each time a tag is pushed to
[singpath/classmentors].


## Pushing new release

Bump the `package.json` version number, commit it, create a new tag and push
the change and the new tag. You can use `npm version major|minor|patch` or
`bin/release`:
```
./bin/release patch
```

## Travis configuration

Travis uses encrypted Github API token to upload the package.

To reset it, delete the the oauth token named "automatic releases for singpath/classmentors"
on your [Github setting page](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

Then run:
```
npm run travis-setup
```
